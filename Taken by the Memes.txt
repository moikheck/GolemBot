Oh, When the music stops playing
And silence falls on the room
My ears begin ringing,
The deafness opens up my tomb.
I can hear the voices,
but none of them are yours,
The record makes noises,
but it's beat is harsh and course.
What we used to have was golden,
But now those days are olden.


\
Our trip down Memory Lane
Is full of scars and pain,
A scrapbook of scrapped dreams.

But you and I both know
the way love seems to go,
my heart taken by the memes.

You said, "Kermit the Frog belongs to TV only,"
and I felt our bonding break.
When I said, "I literally can't even,"
You seemed to buzz and shake.
"Joe Biden is so 2012," was your hurtful animosity.
You looked at all my other memes like they were an atrocity.

Oh, We used to argue and bicker,
Neither side would ever give.
Our words would sting and injure,
like a makeshift prison shiv.
Oh, we tried, and tried, and tried,
to find some common ground,
but to no prevail our love had failed
with it's resonating sound.
What we used to have was Kleenex,
and now it's the Great Value bargain brand.

Now, I had one fleeting hope then,
one thing God had blessed us with.
I opened up iFunny,
Flipped over to saved gifs.
I displayed my current findings,
but to your unfaithful eyes,
my stockpile of cute cat memes
was a breakup in disguise.
What we used to have was monstrous,
but now it's something so impossibly small that scientists
 would have to use one of those fancy microscopes they use to see atoms.

Just because they're old and overused doesn't mean they're an atrocity.
